This repo is only for study purposes. It was used as FACISA Post-degree Android Module Final Project App.
As REST API, I used [OpenFlights API](https://openflights.org/) for airports search (https://openflights.org/html/apsearch).

It was rated 9.5/10 by the module professor @nglauber.

Check out the [demo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pos.jgeraldo.com.openflightsandroidsample).
